# AI Text Summarizer (Beginner NLP Project)

## 📖 Overview
This project is a **beginner-friendly introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)** using Python.  
It implements a **simple extractive text summarization algorithm** that selects the most important sentences from a given text.

The goal of this project is **learning**, not complexity:
- Understand how text can be processed by machines
- Learn basic NLP concepts
- Build confidence before moving to advanced AI and LLMs

## 🧠 How It Works
The summarizer follows these steps:
1. Splits the text into sentences
2. Tokenizes words
3. Removes common stop words
4. Calculates word frequency
5. Scores each sentence based on important words
6. Returns the top-ranked sentences as a summary

This is known as **extractive summarization**, where sentences are selected from the original text rather than generated.
